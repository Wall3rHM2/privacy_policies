I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (skins, coins) are created by you, 
stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. Homever, i use Unity Ads system, which might use data as a identifier for your phone or network related informations.
